Jaspersoft:06/10/2023:
iReports(looks like Netbeans IDE) - Older Name for jasper Reports tool
Jaspersoft(looks like eclipse IDE) - New name for Jasper reports tool

Jaspersoft - Take over by Tibco - Take over By Cloud Group(2023)

Definition: Jasper Reports is an open source reporting tool built on JAVA. Which can represent data in both text as well as Graphically.

All the Invoice Reports are also known as text/cann reports.
All the reports which has Graphs are known as visualization reports.

Advantages/Features of Jasper Reports:
1) Open Source - No license and publicly available for customization.
2) Jasper is capable of both Text and Visualization reports.
3) Wide variety of data export options. - PDF, Excel, CSV, PPT, Word, HTML, XML, JSON
4) Jasper has great/many data source lists. - Excel, CSV, JSON, XML, JDBC DB, Cloud DB
5) Customizing the Jaspersoft Studio and Jasper Server as per our business needs.

Repository Explorer: Folder place in Studio where it has 2 things
1) Data Adapter - Its an interface which will allow us to connect to different data sources(like csv, excel, JDBC, MongDB, XML,JSON)
2) Server

DB's: Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL/Sybase/Netezza/DB2/Amazon Redshift 
which will store the data in tablular(tables) format

7/10/2023

create table employee
(
EmpID int,
Name varchar,
Email varchar,
location varchar,
Salary int

);

insert into employee values (1, 'Ram', 'ram@gmail.com','Bangalore',50000);
insert into employee values (2, 'Dinesh', 'dinesh@gmail.com','Bangalore',100000);
insert into employee values (3, 'Viswa', 'viswa@gmail.com','Bangalore',200000);
insert into employee values (4, 'Koushik', 'Koushik@gmail.com','Bangalore',80000);

Created data adapter which connected to PostgreSQL
Created a simple report by pointing to that data adapter and written SQL query to pull the employee data. brough all those fields from tbale to report and drag them into detail band. Click on preview to see the output.

Data types: To represent what kind of data, we use data types.

Integer - to store only numeric numbers without decimals - Ex: EMPID
Long -  to store only numeric numbers without decimals, but it will store big integers - Ex ADHAAR
Boolean - True/False - Ex: Marital status
String - To store grouped characters "RAM12345@#"
Double - To store decimal values - EX- product cost- 20.45
BigDecimal -  To store bigger decimal values we use this data type - Ex: to store salaries, product cost
Date - To store any date to be printed/manipulated we use Date data type: Ex: Emp DOB, DOJ

java.lang.String

Styles: To apply conditional colouring

Advantages:
1. Can apply Conditional colours.
2. Code reusability

Sort Fields: To sort the report output based on fields(Asc or desc), We can sort with either numbers or strings

Task:
Apply Styles for Product details(from Sample DB data adapter)
Highlight product name as per below conditions
From $5 - $10 - Yellow
From $11 - $20 - Green
From $21 - $30 - Orange
Above $31  Red


12/10/2023

Variable: It's a place holder to hold some calculated valaues in it. 
2 types of variables
Deafualt - provided by Jaspsersoft
Custom - created by Developer

Aggregate Functions:
SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT, DISTINCT COUNT

Rows:1,2,3,4,5,6
Alternate Rows: 2,4,6

4%2 = 0
5%2 = 1

Styles:
We can apply only one style at a time to any element.
Incase of back color style we have to uncheck the transperant option then only it will work.

13/10/2023

Variable: It's a place holder to hold the calculated/aggregated valaues of a specific field. 
2 types of variables
Deafualt var - provided by Jaspsersoft - Report_count, page_number, few more
Custom var - created by Developer - Ex total_salary or total_prod_cost

Ex:total_salary=SUM($F{salary})

*To suppress any null values, property name is BlankWhenNull.

15/10/2023: DB

SQL:
what is DB - Stored collection of data together in a place - Ex: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle, Sybase, Netezza, Amazon 		  						Redshift, DB2
        RDBMS- Relational Database Management System - Table relations
        SQL - Structure Query Language - to communicate with any DB - insert/delete/creating db ojects/all kind of transactons               will be done with SQL
Tools(IDE): MySQL(MysQL workbenk), Postgres(PgAdmin, Dbiewer, DataGrip), Oracle(plsql), Sybase and Redshift DB(Aginity), Dbiewer


What is schema: Schema is like a folder to group all related data together
What DDL/DML/DQL/TCL/DCL?
	DDL -Data Def Lang -  
	DML - Data Manipulation Lang
	DQL - Data Query
	TCL - Transactional Control lang
	DCL - Data control Lang

Table: Table is a physical DB oject, where it allows users to store data for the business cases. A, B, C, D, E
View: Static DB oject - internally connect to all the tables and perform the select function and bring the data.
select * from table/view
Stored Procedure: Stored Proc is a programatic way of executing specific business function which takes some input and gives its respective output data.
call stored_procedure_name(dept_id IN, Salary OUT)

Break:30min
How SELECT query with synatx?
SELECT
c1,c2
FROM Table1
JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY

EX:
select department, SUM(salary) 
from employees
where department like 'C%'
group by department
HAVING SUM(salary)>=4000000
ORDER BY SUM(salary) desc;

Aggregate functions in SQL COUNT, DISTINCT COUNT,MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM
Where/Having/Case statement?

CASE WHEN gender='F'
THEN 'Female'
WHEN gender='M'
THEN 'Male'
ELSE gender
END as gender_c,

JOINS - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN , RIGHT JOIN , Outer JOIN
select *
from employees e
JOIN departments d ON d.department=e.department
where d.department ilike 'co%';


Primary Key:

CREATE TABLE Emp(
    empid int NOT NULL,
    col2 varchar(50) NOT NULL,
    col3 int,
    …………….
    PRIMARY KEY (empid)
);


CREATE TABLE contract_employees(
    empid1 int NOT NULL,
    col2 int NOT NULL,
    col3 int,
    ………...
    PRIMARY KEY (col1),
    FOREIGN KEY (empid1) REFERENCES Emp(empid)
);

Primary keys 


select * 
from Emp e
JOIN contract_employess ce ON ce.empid1=e.empid 
where ce.YOJ=2023;


Advanced SQL
ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, Sub query, CTE, Few Window Functions

16/10/23: Parameters
C:\Users\Ramtom\AppData\Local\Programs\goto

Parameter is an input object which takes values as input and filter the report for that input values and give the respective output. 

represented with $P{}
default expression so that we dont have to always give the values.

Today Task:
Bring the employees data who satisfy the following criteria:
I wanted to see only employees from Computers dept - parameter
and sorted with gender
and salary range between 80000 to 120000
and apply the styles to highlight the employee name with RED color whose salary>100000
and apply alternate row color
Beautify the column headers


17/10/2023: Differernt level of filtering in query and report

Query level: we filter with where clause
Report level: use print when expression for conditional printing, ,means only when that condition becomes true then only that particular elements will be printed.
Conditional printing will be achieved with Print When Expression property. 

Task:
I wanted a employee report output with following scenarios
Bring the employee data from region 3 aand region 5
Salary between 80000 to 120000
Department should be parameter
Detail band values to bro printed only when number of employees are greater than 5
Styles:must used to highlight salaries more than 1L and alternate row color.


18/10/2023
SQL:Joins we used
The best band to be used for Table and Crosstab is Summary band
Table: Jaspersoft table represents data in column basis.
Crosstab: Jaspersoft Crosstab represents data in columns and rows basis.

When to go for table: When the requirement to show the data only column basis then we chose Table.
When to go for Crosstab: When the requirement to show the data dynamically against rows and columns.

Task:
Create a new report which shows division wise employee count and total salary for that division(division, emp_count,total_salary)
These details should not be printed for Electronics division? scenario challenge - use google to find the solution


19/10/2023
&& --- AND
|| --- OR

TRUE && FALSE = 1 * 0 =FALSE
TRUE || FALSE = 1 + 0 =TRUE

Ternary operator: Ternary opr will be used to check the conditions and print custom values instead of printing DB values.

A==B ? c : D

2==2 ? 5 : 7

2==3 ? 6 : 10


category 
if emp_count bw 70 to 90 then print Small division
if emp_count bw 91 to 120 then print Medium division
if emp_count bw 121 and above then print bigger division

Task:
JOIN Employee  --and Dept tables
Print Dept and count of employees
3rd column is Dept_size
 if emp_count bw 5 to 20 then print small dept
 if emp_count bw 21 to 40 then print Medium dept
 if emp_count bw 41 and above then print bigger dept

Conditional Print: dont print Sports and Tools department

Level of filters in jaspersoft Studio
Level1: using where clause in Query dataset
Level2: Using filter expresion in Qauery dataset
Level3: applying printwhenexpression to the entire row/frame/band

Tables:
How to add custom column
how to add variables to the columns(dept category)
how to sort the table data
how apply alternate row color
how to use column footer (will print toatls at each page end)
and table footer(will print total at end of table)

Task:
Create a table with division and emp_count
add custom column with dvision_category with 3 bands of emp count

if emp_count bw 70 to 90 then print small divi
 if emp_count bw 91 to 120 then print Medium divi
 if emp_count 121 and above then print bigger divi

sort table with emp_count
apply alternate_row_color


24/10/2023
Crosstab: To display dynamic data against rows and columns then we use Crosstab.
Table: To display data aginst only columns then we use table.
Sorting in crosstab, styles(alternate row clour var is ROW_COUNT), Measures

Task:
Create a crosstab with Dept as row groups and country as coulmn group and total_salary as measure.
Apply alternate row color
sort the country names in descending order. 


25/10/23
Groups: If you want to display Hierarchy data then we use Groups.
Ex: Top 10 emp's data for each Country, Bring all the district info from different states

Steps:
1) get the field from main report dataset which you wanted to do the grouping(Country)
2) Right click on the report and create a group, select the filed which you wanted to create group
3) Put Country field in Group Header, calculation: No calc
4) Bring table from palette, create new dataset with query which bring top 2 emp data using where filter(regions.country=$P{country_p})
5) Go to table properties, select dataset, click parameters, clik add map parameter which we have created while making new data set, with the field.


01/11/2023

SubReport: Sub report is an report element which will be embedded into another rpeort.
Why subreport: 
1) When we wanted to show 2 reports data together. 
2) When you wanted to show data from different queries together in a singel report.

02/11/2023

Break: We also called this as page break since its going to break the page into separate page
